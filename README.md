# Board-Game-Review-Predictor
A board game predictor using linear regression and random forest model.
- In this average rating of the games is predicted using both these models.

# Results
Results show that the Random Forest Regressor model show desirable accuracy in comparison to the Linear Regression model.
Our calculated mean_squared_error is less in Random Forest Regressor model, so its a better choice for predicting our rating.
