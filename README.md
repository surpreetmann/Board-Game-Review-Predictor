# Board-Game-Review-Predictor
- A board game predictor using linear regression and random forest model.
- In this average rating of the games is predicted using both these models.

# Results and observations
- Results show that the Random Forest Regressor model show desirable accuracy in comparison to the Linear Regression model.
- Our calculated mean_squared_error is less in Random Forest Regressor model.
- The predictions made through RFR were closer to the actual value of ratings by a tiny fraction.
